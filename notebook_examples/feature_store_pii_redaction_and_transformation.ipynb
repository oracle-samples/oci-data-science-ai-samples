    "Benefits of Data Transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Redact**: Uses a spaCy model to remove names, emails, phone numbers and other sensitive information from a document. Runs locally to avoid sending sensitive data to third party APIs.\n",
    "2. **Summarize**: Summarize the information in a document. token_limit may be passed to configure the size of the summary, however it may not be respected by OpenAI.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Remove all information from a document unless it's related to a specific set of topics.\n",
    "4. **Translate**: Translates text into another language.\n",
    "5. **Interrogate**: Convert information in a document into question and answer format. End user queries often take the form of a question, so converting information into questions and creating indexes from these questions often yields better results when using a vector database for context retrieval.\n",

    "\n",
    "Oracle feature store is a stack based solution that is deployed in the customer enclave using OCI resource manager. Customer can stand up the service with infrastructure in their own tenancy. The service consists of API which are deployed in customer tenancy using resource manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some key terms that will help you understand OCI Data Science Feature Store:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Vector**: Set of feature values for any one primary/identifier key. Eg. All/subset of features of customer id ‘2536’ can be called as one feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature**: A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entity**: An entity is a group of semantically related features. The first step a consumer of features would typically do when accessing the feature store service is to list the entities and the entities associated features. Another way to look at it is that an entity is an object or concept that is described by its features. Examples of entities could be customer, product, transaction, review, image, document, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Group**: A feature group in a feature store is a collection of related features that are often used together in ml models. It serves as an organizational unit within the feature store for users to manage, version and share features across different ml projects. By organizing features into groups, data scientists and ml engineers can efficiently discover, reuse and collaborate on features reducing the redundant work and ensuring consistency in feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Group Job**: Feature group job is the execution instance of a feature group. Each feature group job will include validation results and statistics results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset**: A dataset is a collection of feature that are used together to either train a model or perform model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset Job**: Dataset job is the execution instance of a dataset. Each dataset job will include validation results and statistics results."

However, you must update the template so that the Data Catalog metastore can be accessed. You can do this manually. However, the `odsc data-catalog config` commandline tool is ideal for setting up the file because it gathers information about your environment, and uses that to build the file.\n",

Following are common parameters that you may need to override.\n",

The preferred method for authentication is resource principal, which is sent with `--authentication resource_principal`. If you want to use API keys, then use the `--authentication api_key` option.
