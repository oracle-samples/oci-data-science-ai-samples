    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset consists of approximately 10 hours of 640x480 30Hz video taken from a vehicle driving through regular traffic in an urban environment. The data consists of about 250,000 frames in 137 approximately one-minute-long segments. There are approximately 350,000 bounding boxes and 2,300 unique pedestrians have been annotated. The annotation includes temporal correspondence between bounding boxes and detailed occlusion labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to download the data from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage. It helps you understand the data and extract images from `.seq` files to a target folder.\n",

Both of which are about 1 GB and contain 6 to 13 one-minute-long `.seq` files along with annotation. Refer to the papers [Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/files/PAMI12pedestrians.pdf) and [Pedestrian Detection: A Benchmark](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/files/CVPR09pedestrians.pdf) for more details.\n",

    "Oracle Open Data is a free service that curates spatial images, protein sequences, and annotated text files from the world's leading scientific databases. The repository connects researchers, developers, students, and educators with petabytes of open data from trusted resources. You can use Oracle Open Data to view important metadata and sample code for each data set, which simplifies technical complexities and makes it easy for researchers to use.\n",

    "OCI Object Storage enables you to securely store any type of data in its native format. With built-in redundancy, Object Storage is ideal for building modern applications that require scale and flexibility because you can use it to consolidate multiple data sources for analytics, backup, or archive purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark for video data are stored in Object Storage in the SEQ format. You can run the next cell to download and extract the files to a directory. Use training set `set00` as an example."
