# Deploy Meta Llama 3.1 405B

This tutorial will show you how to do inferencing with a model downloaded from Hugging Face. For this we will use [Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct) from Meta. The Llama 3.1 405B is a state-of-the-art open source model (with a custom commercial license, the Llama 3.1 Community License). With a context window of up to 128K and support across eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai), it rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation.

## Required IAM Policies

Add these [policies](https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/main/model-deployment/containers/llama2#required-iam-policies) to grant access to OCI services.

## Setup

```python
# Install required python packages

pip install oracle-ads oci huggingface_hub -U
```

```python
import os
# Uncomment this code and set the correct proxy links if have to setup proxy for internet
# os.environ['http_proxy']="http://myproxy"
# os.environ['https_proxy']="http://myproxy"

# Use os.environ['no_proxy'] to route traffic directly
```

```python
import ads
ads.set_auth("resource_principal")

# Extract region information from the Notebook environment variables and signer.
ads.common.utils.extract_region()
```

## Prepare The Model Artifacts

To prepare Model artifacts for LLM model deployment:

- Download the model files from huggingface to local directory using a valid huggingface token (only needed for gated models). If you don't have Huggingface Token, refer [this](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to generate one.
- Upload the model folder to a [versioned bucket](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingversioning.htm) in Oracle Object Storage. If you donâ€™t have an Object Storage bucket, create one using the OCI SDK or the Console. Create an Object Storage bucket. Make a note of the `namespace`, `compartment`, and `bucketname`. Configure the policies to allow the Data Science service to read and write the model artifact to the Object Storage bucket in your tenancy. An administrator must configure the policies in IAM in the Console.
- Create model catalog entry for the model using the Object storage path

### Model Download from HuggingFace Model Hub

You can to [HuggingFace documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) for details.

```python
# Login to huggingface using env variable
huggingface-cli login --token "<your-huggingface-token>"

# Download the LLama3.1 405B model from Hugging Face to a local folder  

huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8 --local-dir Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8


```

## Upload Model to OCI Object Storage

```python
model_prefix = "Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8/" #"<bucket_prefix>"
bucket= "<bucket_name>" # this should be a versioned bucket
namespace = "<bucket_namespace>"

!oci os object bulk-upload --src-dir $local_dir --prefix $model_prefix -bn $bucket -ns $namespace --auth "resource_principal"
```

## Create Model by Reference using ADS

```python
from ads.model.datascience_model import DataScienceModel

artifact_path = f"oci://{bucket}@{namespace}/{model_prefix}"

model = (DataScienceModel()
  .with_compartment_id(compartment_id)
  .with_project_id(project_id)
  .with_display_name("Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8")
  .with_artifact(artifact_path)
)

model.create(model_by_reference=True)
```
## Inference container

vLLM is an easy-to-use library for LLM inference and server.  You can get the container image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vllm/vllm-openai/tags).

```python
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 vllm/vllm-openai:v0.5.3.post1
```

This container image published by the vLLM team has:

- CUDA 12.4.1
- cuDNN 9
- Torch 2.3.1
- Python 3.10
- vLLM v0.5.3.post1

Currently, OCI Data Science Model Deployment only supports container images residing in the OCI Registry.  Before we can push the pulled vLLM container, make sure you have created a repository in your tenancy.  
- Go to your tenancy Container Registry
- Click on the Create repository button
- Select Private under Access types
- Set a name for Repository name.  We are using "vllm-odsc "in the example.
- Click on Create button

You may need to docker login to the Oracle Cloud Container Registry (OCIR) first, if you haven't done so before in order to push the image. To login, you have to use your API Auth Token that can be created under your Oracle Cloud Account->Auth Token. You need to login only once. Replace <region> with the OCI region you are using.

```python
docker login -u '<tenant-namespace>/<username>' <region>.ocir.io
```

If your tenancy is federated with Oracle Identity Cloud Service, use the format <tenancy-namespace>/oracleidentitycloudservice/<username>. You can then push the container image to the OCI Registry

```python
docker tag vllm/vllm-openai:v0.5.3.post1 -t <region>.ocir.io/<tenancy>/vllm-odsc/vllm-openai:v0.5.3.post1
docker push <region>.ocir.io/<tenancy>/vllm-odsc/vllm-openai:v0.5.3.post1
```
### Set up Common variables

```python
# change as required for your environment
compartment_id = os.environ["PROJECT_COMPARTMENT_OCID"]
project_id = os.environ["PROJECT_OCID"]

log_group_id = "ocid1.loggroup.oc1.xxx.xxxxx"
log_id = "cid1.log.oc1.xxx.xxxxx"

instance_shape = "BM.GPU.H100.8"
container_image = "<region>.ocir.io/<tenancy>/vllm-odsc/vllm-openai:v0.5.3.post1"  # name given to vllm image pushed to oracle  container registry  
region = <your-region>
```


### Import Model Deployment Modules

```python
from ads.model.deployment import (
    ModelDeployment,
    ModelDeploymentContainerRuntime,
    ModelDeploymentInfrastructure,
    ModelDeploymentMode,
)
```

### Setup Model Deployment Infrastructure

```python
infrastructure = (
    ModelDeploymentInfrastructure()
    .with_project_id(project_id)
    .with_compartment_id(compartment_id)
    .with_shape_name(instance_shape)
    .with_bandwidth_mbps(10)
    .with_replica(1)
    .with_web_concurrency(10)
    .with_access_log(
        log_group_id=log_group_id,
        log_id=log_id,
    )
    .with_predict_log(
        log_group_id=log_group_id,
        log_id=log_id,
    )
)
```

### Configure Model Deployment Runtime

```python
env_var = {
    'MODEL_DEPLOY_PREDICT_ENDPOINT': '/v1/completions',
    'MODEL_DEPLOY_ENABLE_STREAMING': 'true',
    'SHM_SIZE': '10g'
}

cmd_var = ["--model", "/opt/ds/model/deployed_model/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8/", "--tensor-parallel-size", "8", "--port", "8080", "--served-model-name", "llama3.1", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--max-model-len", "1200", "--trust-remote-code"]

container_runtime = (
    ModelDeploymentContainerRuntime()
    .with_image(container_image)
    .with_server_port(8080)
    .with_health_check_port(8080)
    .with_env(env_var)
    .with_cmd(cmd_var)
    .with_deployment_mode(ModelDeploymentMode.HTTPS)
    .with_model_uri(model.id)
    .with_region(region)
)
```

### Deploy Model Using Container Runtime

```python
deployment = (
    ModelDeployment()
    .with_display_name(f"Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct with vLLM docker container")
    .with_description("Deployment of Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct MD with vLLM(0.5.3.post1) container")
    .with_infrastructure(infrastructure)
    .with_runtime(container_runtime)
).deploy(wait_for_completion=False)
```

### Inference

Once the model deployment has reached the Active state, we can invoke the model deployment endpoint to interact with the LLM. More details on different ways for accessing MD endpoints is documented [here](https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/ai-quick-actions/model-deployment-tips.md).


#### How to prompt Llama 3.1

The base models have no prompt format. The Instruct versions use the following conversation structure:

```xml
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 25 Jul 2024

You are a helpful assistant<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

<prompt> <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

This format has to be exactly reproduced for effective use.


```python
import requests
import ads
from string import Template
from datetime import datetime

ads.set_auth("resource_principal")
endpoint = f"https://modeldeployment.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/{deployment.model_deployment_id}/predict"

current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%d %B %Y")

prompt_template= Templatef(f"""<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

                    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
                    Today Date: {current_date}

                    You are a helpful assistant<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

                    $prompt<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>""")

prompt = prompt_template.substitute(prompt= "What amateur radio bands are best to use when there are solar flares?")

requests.post(
    endpoint,
    json={
        "model": "llama3.1",
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "top_p": 0.8,
    },
    auth=ads.common.auth.default_signer()["signer"],
    headers={},

During solar flares, radio communications can be disrupted due to increased ionization and geomagnetic storms. However, some amateur radio bands are more resilient to these conditions than others. Here are some bands that are often considered best to use during solar flares:

1. **VHF (30 MHz - 300 MHz) and UHF (300 MHz - 3 GHz) bands**: These higher frequency bands are less affected by solar flares and geomagnetic storms. They are also less prone to ionospheric absorption, which can attenuate signals on lower frequency bands.
2. **6 meters (50 MHz)**: This band is often considered a good choice during solar flares, as it is less affected by ionospheric disturbances and can provide reliable local and regional communications.
3. **2 meters (144 MHz) and 70 cm (440 MHz)**: These bands are popular for local and regional communications and are often less affected by solar flares.
4. **Microwave bands (e.g., 1.2 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz)**: These bands are even less affected by solar flares and can provide reliable communications over shorter distances.

Bands to avoid during solar flares:

1. **HF (3 MHz - 30 MHz) bands**: These lower frequency bands are more susceptible to ionospheric absorption and geomagnetic storms, which can cause signal loss and disruption.
2. **160 meters (1.8 MHz) and 80 meters (3.5 MHz)**: These bands are often the most affected by solar flares and geomagnetic storms.

Keep in mind that the impact of solar flares on amateur radio communications can vary depending on the intensity of the flare, the location of the communicating stations, and the time of day. It's always a good idea to monitor space weather forecasts and adjust your communication plans accordingly.


#### Using the model from [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/llms/oci_model_deployment_endpoint/)
