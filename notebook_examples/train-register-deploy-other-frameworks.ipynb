    "The notebook demonstrates how to to train, test, save and deploy an instance of the `GenericModel` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GenericModel` class in Accelerated Data Science (ADS) allows you to rapidly get a model into production. The `.prepare()` method creates the model artifacts that are needed to deploy a functioning model without you having to configure it or write code, including the ability to customize the `score.py` file as needed. The model can be subsequently verified, saved, and deployed.\n",
