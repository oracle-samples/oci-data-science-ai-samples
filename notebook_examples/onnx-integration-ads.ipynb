    "This notebook showcases the integration between Open Neural Network Exchange, ([ONNX](https://onnx.ai/)), `ADS`, and `sklearn`. ONNX is an open standard for machine learning interoperability that enables easy deployment of models. ONNX is an extensible computational graph model with built-in operators and machine-independent data types. The operators are portable across hardware and frameworks. The computational flow is an acyclic graph that contains information about the flow of the data and also metadata. Each node in the data flow graph contains an operator that can accept multiple inputs and produce multiple outputs.\n",
