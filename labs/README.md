# Pi Day 2022 AI Workshop

This lab is built for use as a workshop at the Oracle Pi Day event in March 2022. It uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vision service to show how AI services can be used with applications. The workshop guides the user to run a safety application that that looks for persons not wearing hardhats in images of industrial scenes.

### Prerequisites
  - None

This workshop is designed for users that will register for a new OCI trial account with free cloud credits.  The workshop provides instructions to sign up for a free trial account and then configure the tenancy for OCI Vision. The remainder of the workshop guides the user through activities to analyze images in the OCI console, exercise the REST API, and run a Python application.

**Pi Day participants need to sign-up for their OCI account with the same email that was provided to Oracle when registering for the event.** By doing so, participants receive additional free cloud credits and no payment method verification.

Other users of this workshop may sign-up for a standard OCI trial account that provides free cloud credits but requires a payment method verification as an identity check. (The user is not charged during the free trial and the user has the option to continue with free tier services or explicitly convert to a paid account at the end of the trial. Note that OCI Vision is not included in the OCI free tier but does provide free transactions [i.e. service calls] every month.)

If you choose to use an existing OCI trial account, your 30-day trial must still be active and you must have credits remaining on your account to cover the services used in this workshop. (Your trial status is displayed in the OCI console.)

You may of course also use a paid OCI account, however the instructions are designed for a new trial account, and your account will be charged for the services used during this workshop.
