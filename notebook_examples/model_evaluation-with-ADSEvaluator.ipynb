    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate the capabilities of the `ADSEvaluator`. It is a machine learning (ML) evaluation component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Accelerated Data Science (ADS) package. You will learn how it can be used for the evaluation of any general class of supervised machine learning models, as well as comparison amongst models within the same class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the notebook will focus on binary classification using an imbalanced dataset, multi-class classification using a synthetically generated dataset consisting of three equally distributed classes and lastly a regression using a synthetically generated dataset with positive targets. The training is done using a standard library, and subsequently, the models would be evaluated using `ADSEvaluator`.\n",
