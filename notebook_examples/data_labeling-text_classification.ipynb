    "Data labeling is the process of identifying specific properties or characteristics of raw data (text and images) and applying annotations called labels. Examples of meaningful labels are the topic of a news article, the sentiment of a tweet, the caption for an image, important words spoken in an audio recording, the genre of a video, etc. The purpose of data labeling is to create enriched, labeled datasets. These labeled datasets are required inputs for many machine learning applications.\n",

    "The OCI Data Labeling service (DLS) allows customers to create and browse datasets, view data records (text, images), and apply labels to build AI/ML models. The service also provides interactive user interfaces designed to aid in the labeling process. Once records are labeled, the dataset can be exported as line-delimited JSON for machine learning model development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are the core resource available within the Data Labeling service. Datasets contain records and their associated labels. A record represents a single image or text document. Records are stored by reference to their original source, such as a path on Object Storage. Customers can also upload records from local storage. Labels are annotations that describe a data record. In the case of text, labels may include the beginning and ending character position. Labeled datasets can be exported as a JSON manifest for use as an input to machine learning model development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training datasets that are used in natural language processing applications require a corpus of raw text that is tagged. The tags indicate the important parts of the text, and labels are assigned to these tags. There are different types of labeling, such as parts of speech (POS) or named entities. POS would identify words or phrases such as a noun, verb, adverb, or adjective. Name entities would identify proper nouns and places within the text, such as Carey and Redwood City. The start and end positions are identified in the text, and a label is associated with that bounded region.\n",
