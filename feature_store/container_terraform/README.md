This module handles opinionated [Feature Store][feature_store_docs] setup using container service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ([OCI][oci]). This stack is designed to be used with the [OCI Resource Manager][oci_rm] to provision Feature store in a single step. The stack can also be used with the [OCI Terraform Provider][oci_tf_provider] to deploy using local or CloudShell Terraform cli.
