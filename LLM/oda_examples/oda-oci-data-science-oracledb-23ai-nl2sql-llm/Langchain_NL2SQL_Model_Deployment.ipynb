      "2024 Oracle Partner Awards – Official Rules Standard Judging Page 6 of 9 transformational outcomes. As an example, these metrics may demonstrate improvement from a before and after scenario. Examples of performance metrics include: ROI from CapEx/OpEx improvement, accuracy indicators, time saved from automation, lower processing times, improved diagnostics capabilities to identify and fix potential problems, higher yields, faster response times from data-driven decisions, reduction in time-to-market, streamlined compliance and records management, and improved employee experience. For Systems Integrator partners, the nomination should articulate key investments the partner has incorporated into their practice and on what Oracle solutions their practice is focused. Partners should include information that describes training and certification of their staff, the types of customer projects that their practice includes within project documented timelines, volume of service requests to Oracle and volume of projects escalated to Oracle. For training and certification, the nomination will need to include the number of people that are trained and certified on the specific Oracle product(s); what percentage of the partners total staff is trained and certified on an Oracle technology. For oracle solution practice areas, the nomination will need to include the number of projects the partner completed and the number of those projects are referenceable. This information should compare the number of successful projects against a percentage of the total projects that the partner has completed in the same timeframe. The partner nomination should describe the best and most successful customer project that includes partner-centric metrics for on-time delivery with descriptions of how project milestones were achieve, post implementation service requests and other project-related factors. 2024 PARTNER AWARD SELECTION OF WINNERS After the Nomination period closes on 14 June 2024 at 11:59 pm in the corresponding time zone to the respective geographical location, the submissions will be reviewed for eligibility and completion aligning with instructions on the Nomination form and the eligibility requirements in these rules. Potential finalists/winners will be confidentially informed prior to 9 September 2024. When the Sponsor notifies potential finalists/winner(s), each potential finalist/winner will be required to sign a legal affidavit of eligibility to receive the award and release forms granting permission for the Sponsor to announce the finalist/winner and reference finalist/winner as a customer of the Sponsor in Sponsor’s marketing materials. A Nominee will not be announced as an award finalist/winner without successful completion of the affidavit and release forms. If the Sponsor is unable to reach a potential finalist/winner, or if the affidavit and release forms are not properly completed and returned to the Sponsor by the date requested, or if an award notification is returned as undeliverable, or if a potential finalist/winner is found not to have complied with these Official Rules in any way, the award will be forfeited and an alternate winner will be selected. Potential finalist/winner(s) will be given a deadline to respond and return the completed affidavit and release forms. All decisions by Oracle are final. Oracle reserves the right to modify or terminate the Oracle Awards promotion at any time and at its sole discretion. AWARDS WINNER BENEFITS Each of the category winners are based on the criteria noted in the Selection of Winners section above. Prizes are non-monetary benefits, as recognition is the basis of the awards. Winner benefits are the following: 1. 2024 Oracle Partner Award badge for partner to use on Webpages, solution and information documents, customer presentations and other promotional materials. 2. Published announcements of each winner on the Oracle Regional Partner Awards Webpages 3. Published announcement winners may be published on Oracle social media channels and related Oracle communities. 4. Published announcement winners may be mentioned at any Oracle event whether the awards are announced virtually or in person. 5. Potential to publish partner success story on Oracle.com as well as mentioned in other marketing activities (articles; press releases; blogs; videos; webcasts, etc.).\n",
