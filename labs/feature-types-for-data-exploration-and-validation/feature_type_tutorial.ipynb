    "There is a distinction between the data type of a feature and the nature of data that it represents. The data type represents the form of the data that the computer understands. ADS uses the term \"feature type\" to refer to the nature of the data. For example, a medical record id could be represented as an integer, its data type, but the feature type would be \"medical record id\". The feature type represents the data the way the data scientist understands it. ADS provides the feature type module on top of your Pandas dataframes and series to manage and use the typing information to better understand your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type framework comes with some common feature types. However, the power of using feature types is that you can easily create your own and apply them to your specific data. You don't need to try to represent your data in a synthetic way that does not match the nature of your data. This framework allows you to create methods that validate whether the data fits the specifications of your organization. For example, for a medical record type, you could create methods to validate that the data is properly formatted. You can also have the system generate warnings to sure the data is valid as a whole or create graphs for summary plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework allows you to create and assign multiple feature types. For example, a medical record id could also have a feature type id and the integer feature type.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type system allows data scientists to separate the concept of how data is represented physically from what the data actually measures. That is, the data can have feature types that classify the data based on what it represents and not how the data is stored in memory. Each set of data can have multiple feature types through a system of multiple inheritances. As a concrete example, an organization that sells cars might have a set of data that represents the purchase price of a car, that is the wholesale price. You  could have a feature set of `wholesale_price`, `car_price`, `USD`, and `continuous`. \n",
    "\n",
    "All default feature types have methods for creating summary statistics and a plot to represent the data. This allows you to have summary information for each feature of your dataset while only using a single command. However, the default feature types may not provide the exact details needed in your specific use case. Therefore, feature types have been designed with expandability in mind. When creating a new feature type, the summary statistics and plots that are specific to your feature type can be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type system works at the Pandas dataframe and series levels. This allows you to create summary information across all of your data and at the same time dig into the specifics of one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.feature_count()` method returns a dataframe that provides a summary of the number of features in a dataframe. Each row represents a feature type. It provides a count of the number of times that feature type is used in the dataframe. It also provides a count of the number of times that the feature type was the primary feature type. The primary feature type is the feature type that has no children feature types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.feature_stat()` method returns a dataframe where each row represents a summary statistic and the numerical value for that statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.feature_plot()` method returns a Seaborn plot object that summaries the feature. It can be modified after it is returned so that you can customize it to fit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of correlation methods such as `.correlation_ratio()`, `.pearson()`, and `.cramersv()` that provide information about the correlation between different features in the form of a dataframe. Each row represents a single correlation metic. This information can also be represented in a plot with the `.correlation_ratio_plot()`, `.pearson_plot()`, and `.cramersv_plot()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type warnings are used for rapid validation of the data. For example, the `wholesale_price` might have a method that ensures that the value is a positive number because you can't purchase a car with negative money. The `car_price` feature type may have a check to ensure that it is within a reasonable price range. `USD` can check the value to make sure that it represents a valid US dollar amount. It can't have values below one cent. The `continuous` feature type is the default feature type and it represents the way the data is stored internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type validators are a set of `is_*` methods, where `*` is generally the name of the feature type. For example, the method `.is_wholesale_price()` can create a boolean Pandas series that indicates what values meet the validation criteria. It  allows you to quickly identify which values need to be filtered or require future examination into problems in the data pipeline. The feature type validators can be as complex as they need to be. For example, they might take a client ID and call an API to validate that each client ID is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type manager provides the tools to manage the handlers that are used to drive this system. The system works by creating functions that are then registered as feature type validators or warnings. The role of `feature_type_manager` is to provide the interface to manage these handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature type has the following attributes that can be overridden:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `description`: A description of the feature type.\n",
    "- `name`: The name of the feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to create custom summary statistics for a feature type, then override the `.feature_stat()` method. To create a custom summary plot, override the `.feature_plot()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"feature_type\"></a>\n",
    "# Feature Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas dtypes are physical data types that indicate how data are stored. You can call `.dtype` on your Pandas dataframe or series to inspect the physical types. Feature types are the logical types that define how the data should be interpreted by the end user. Feature types categorize the features from the machine learning perspective. Different feature types could be the same physical type. For example, both categorical and ordinal can be an integer dtype. However, the difference between `categorical` and `ordinal` feature types is that `ordinal` features have an ordering while `categorical` features don't. \n",
    "\n",
    "ADS allows a set of data to have multiple feature types through a system of inheritance. For example, a hospital may have a medical record number for each patient. That data might have the feature types `patient_id`, `id`, and `integer`. The `patient_id` is the child feature type with `id` being its parent. The `integer` is the parent of the `id` feature type. It is also the last feature type in the inheritance chain and is called the <a href=\"default_type\">default feature type</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regular feature types, there are two special versions. The <a href=\"default_type\">default type</a> is based on the Pandas dtype and cannot be changed without changing the Pandas dtype. There is no need to set it because it is always the last feature type in the inheritance chain. The <a href=\"#tags\">tag</a> feature type does not support <a href=\"#warnings\">feature type warning</a> nor <a href=\"#handlers\">feature type validators</a>. It is designed to allow you to tag data with extra information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `feature_type_manager.feature_type_registered()`, gives you an overview of all the registered feature types. ADS comes with various common feature types, but the idea is that you create feature types that explicitly define your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`feature_type_manager.feature_type_registered()` returns a dataframe with these columns:\n",
    "- `Class`: registered feature type class.\n",

    "# Feature Type Validators\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to ensure that all the data is valid. For example, you may have credit card data and want to ensure that all the numbers are valid credit card numbers. The feature type validators are a way of performing this validation. There are built-in methods for the feature types that are provided by `ADS`, but the idea is for you to create these methods for your custom feature types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature type validators are defined on the feature type level. You can define functions that can be applied to the columns and features of the same feature type and use it across your entire organization. The feature types that are provided by `ADS` come with a default set of handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type validators are a set of `.is_*()` methods, where `*` is generally the name of the feature type. For example, the method `.is_credit_card()` would be called to ensure that the data are all credit card numbers. The feature type validators return a boolean pandas series, which is the length of the data. If the element meets the criteria specified in the feature type validator, it indicates `True` otherwise it is `False`. The `.is_*()` method is called the **validator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type validator system is extensible. You can have multiple validators for any feature type. For example, if you had a credit card feature type you may want to have the validator `.is_credit_card()`. It would check a set of credit card numbers to make sure that they are valid credit card numbers. You may want to add other validators like, `.is_visa()` and `.is_mastercard()`, to determine if the credit card numbers are associated with Visa or Mastercard accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature type validator can also be extended through the use of conditions. Conditions allow you to have different sets of feature type validators based on a set of arguments that you define called **conditions**. For example, if you wanted to and see if a credit card is a Visa card you could create a condition like `.is_credit_card(card_type='Visa')`. Then you register a feature handler with that condition and it runs when you pass in that condition.\n",

You don't need to try to represent your data in a synthetic way that does not match the nature of your data. This framework allows you to create methods that validate whether the data fits the specifications of your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom feature type, you need to create a class that is inherited from the `FeatureType` class. The class must be registered with ADS before it can be used. You do this using the `feature_type_manager.feature_type_register()` method and pass in the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, the custom feature type, `CustomCreditCard`, is created and is inherited from the `FeatureType` base class. The class overrides the `name` attribute to set a custom name for the class. If it is not overridden then the name will automatically be determined by the class name and converted to snake case. The name can be used to register and unregister a class. It is also used in several outputs to identify the class. When assigning a feature type to a series, the name can be used to identify the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `description` attribute allows you to provide detailed information about a feature type. If it is not overridden the description will default to 'Base Feature Type.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.feature_stat()` provides a mechanism to provide summary statistics for a feature type. If this method is not overridden and `.feature_stat()` is called on a feature type the multiple inheritance mechanism will be used. For example, we may create a feature type called `wholesale_price` and then a Pandas series called `car_price`. `car_price` has the following feature types: `wholesale_price`, `car_price`, `USD`, and `continuous`. Assuming that `.feature_stat()` is not overridden in the `wholesale_price` class, the system will attempt to generate the feature statistics using the `.feature_stat()` method defined in its parent feature type, `car_price`. This will continue until a feature type has defined the `.feature_stat()` method. If none of the custom feature type classes implement `.feature_stat()` it will fall through to the default feature type which always has this method implemented.\n",

    "In the next cell, the `.feature_stat()` method is implemented. It will create a dataframe where the index is the name of the metric. There will be one column that is the value that is associated with the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.feature_plot()` method can be overridden such that a custom plot can be created for the data. Just like the `.feature_stat()` method, if it is not overridden a plot will be generated by the multiple inheritance mechanism. All default feature types have a defined `.feature_plot()`. Since the default feature type's plotting method is generic, it may or may not provide a good representation of the data.\n",
