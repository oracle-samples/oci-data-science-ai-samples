However, just this week they recharged my credit card for our stay in July (its now September). I called them and told them that I had this charge on a previous statement and the lady who apparently was the person to talk to about this, told me that it was a pending change and that it didn't really charge the card. This was BS. Furthermore, she explained how a bunch of credit cards got stuck and the were re-running them. My credit card is currently disputing the charge after confirming that it was a second charge. I will get the charge removed. What bothers me is not so much the mistake, but that this seems highly unethical. I keep close track of my spending in an excel spreadsheet, but if I didn't, which most people probably don't, I probably would have assumed it never got charged and let it go. And if there are people out there doing this to a group of cards, I'm sure many people will let it go and get charged twice. THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PRETTY UNETHICAL.

It was a very nice BB and enjoyed our stay. Here are some specifics: General: * Innkeepers, Karen and John, were very nice. They provide some dinner recommendations which were greatly appreciated. This was a great perk! And, one reason we would stay at a BB over a hotel. * In-ground pool was very clean. Water temperature was 78 degrees when we checked at 10am. * Gardens around pool were very pretty. * Breakfast was so so delicious! Bailey Room: * Very pretty and clean * Whirlpool tub is HUGE! And, the robes/candles were a nice touch! * TV 19 - Fine for us because we were not there to watch TV. * We could hear the people walking above us. This did not bother us. * Bed sheets were luxurious! * Bed was very very firm/flat. We would have appreciated a more luxurious bed. * Bathroom and towels were basic. I would have appreciated fluffier towels. My husband did not notice. * The only way to play music in our room was through the DVD player/TV. It would have been nice to have a good CD player. * No treats, like chocolate, in our room :( This is my second BB experience. My first experience was at a higher priced BB and offered a bit more luxury - but breakfast was definitely not delicious like Karen's at The Bailey House.

As soon as I got in that in-room jacuzzi I was swept away. Karen and John Beckman were so helpful and friendly. The breakfasts were delicious and the breakfast table conversation was so interesting and fun, with both the Beckmans and the other guests at the BB. We took almost all of their advice on restaurants, things to do, etc., as I hadn't done my homework on the area before arriving. No matter! They knew the best spots to go and I'm so glad we took their tips. Barney is just the cutest dog ever---and I'm allergic to dogs, but Barney wasn't a problem at all, as he's a short haired dog and doesn't shed much. The guest rooms are in a separate section of the house and they keep Barney in the main house. There are no mini-fridges in the room, but John was happy to provide us with ample ice and a bucket to chill our wine. He also offered us a space in their fridge if we needed to store anything else. The rooms all have DVD players and they have movies there you can borrow. They also provided us with fluffy white terrycloth robes and aromatherapy beads for the jacuzzi. The gas fireplace was also very nice. It was too cold to swim (May 3-6) but the pool looked great and I was sad I didn't get to try it out.

When I called, the front desk lady/manager Diane was extremely rude and told me there was no way her employee would have told me that there was no cancellation fee. When I told her maybe the employee made a mistake, she said there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar. When I stated that sometimes employees make mistakes and I was positive I had asked about cancel fees, she said that was impossible and that I was wrong and every single hotel in the entire world(!!) charges cancellation fees. After a heated argument, I asked for the corporate number to make a complaint. I explained to the corporate office that I had been sick and was unable to attend and had been given no indication that there would be a cancellation charge (full cost for the over priced room). She was very nice and sympathetic and I confirmed that I could get a doctors note proving I was ill. She said that the Hotel owner or GM would call me to discuss and I would possibly have to provide the doctors note. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard from anyone.

The biggest asset of this BB is the location: it is 10-min. walk to the Harvard Yard. The breakfast was also very good (crepes or flapjacks with blueberries), but could be more varied. Byron, the live-in manager was very helpful and entertaining. I booked this BB based on the very positive reviews, but the standard has obviously dropped since they were written. Having said that, the owners have been working on bringing it back to standard, especially the cleanliness. However, more work is needed to make it a competitive BB, suitable to the needs of business travellers or visitors to Harvard or MIT. It was also too expensive for what it offered (188 a night!) The bathroom is shared! If you are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower. We had 5 people competing for the shower, but the biggest problem was the toilet (no guest WC). The back porch needs a lot of work before it can be enjoyed by the guests, but they do have a selection of books and Byron is a walking encyclopaedia of knowledge about Cambridge and Boston. Parking: you will need a lot of luck or a lot of patience! The apartment is on the third floor, so ask Byron for help with your luggage. Bottom line: Great location, and great potential.

He said there were no more clean rooms, then went to double check that. He went into a room just down from ours and came out 10 mins later w trash and dirty towels. He tried to give us that room. He could not verify that the sheets had been changed and said he didn't blame us for not wanting to stay in the room! LOL Then he offered us another room and we went to check it out.

Similar to other reviews, the website invited me to belief that I would be staying at a clean, charming, BB, with privacy and antiques, but rather I experienced dusty, musty, creaky, invasive, and somewhat haunting of an experience. I had planned to stay three nights, but left after the first night because I couldn't sleep (due to the lack of AIR CONDITIONING and lack of a fan), uncomfortable bed, and the notion that a creepy crawly might crawl over my face while sleeping or showering (yes, there is a plant in the shower.) I've stayed at several BBs in the past and had lovely experiences when the hosts provide a clean, comfortable room and bathroom situation, along with friendly (not invasive and pushy) service, but unfortunately, my experience here was none of that. Once the uncomfortable night was over, I gave a chance to the breakfast served by the Innkeeper, however alongside my crepe, fruit, and bananas (no protein or bread), I received a political and religious lecture to start off my morning as well.

However, I will say that it ended up costing a lot more than we were expecting and I would warn others to think of all the external costs involved. To gain the privacy of the entire facility, you do have to rent out the whole place. Also, you have to rent and obtain vendors for everything else you do there. Nothing is really included. So, you will need to consider sound, lights, tents, chairs, catering, decorations etc. They do include a wedding event coordinator which I considered a bonus at the time but learned too late (on the wedding day) that there is a difference between a coordinator and a planner. She wasn't as adept at keeping the wedding day as organized, put together and stress free as I was expecting or hoping for it to be. Despite that, everything turned out beautiful. We enjoyed having the rehearsal dinner and the wedding ceremony out in the streets under the trees. It was very hot! I think fans or some kind of cooling system would have been a great idea. You do have to buy the alcohol from them but their rates were not bad at all and they were more than willing to go and buy more alcohol when we ran out. They serve a brunch in the mornings for all the guests which is wonderful! Guests who aren't staying there could also join us for brunch but the cost for them was a little steep.

First off, I found four hairs on the bedsheets when I pulled back the covers. Now I know these sometimes get through the wash, but it only takes a minute to take a lint roller or whatever when you make a hotel bed to ensure that the guest gets nice looking unspoiled sheets. Once I noticed that (I was too tired to ask for another room), I started to notice other things: visible stains on laundered hand towels, grubby carpet, very gross looking remote and tv menu card. The last straw was the next morning taking a shower, I pulled back the shower curtain and there was a used washcloth from a previous stay hung up on the shower rod that had been hidden by the curtain until I pulled it back. Gross. I've stayed in a lot of 2 star properties before and 2 star shouldn't mean dirty, it should just mean basic. Wasn't expecting perfection but this really was unpleasant. Oh, and the tissue box ran out of tissues after THREE tissues. Inspecting supplies should be a basic Housekeeping 101, if there are only 3 tissues left in the box you should replace it. Because of the housekeeping I didn't feel like venturing around the Inn to check out any of the other amenities offered like hot tub or breakfast as I felt they'd probably be disappointing as well.

The AC was running but blowing warm air. The floor was also wet and very sticky. Even my shoes were sticking to the carpet. We went and asked to be switched to another room and they told us there were none available. I booked this hotel months in advance and got placed in (what I would hope) was their crappiest room. A maintenance man and the manager came by and told us they would bring in a dehumidifier to fix the problem and that we needed to leave the room for at least 45 min. We had just finished a 6 hr drive and were rushed out of the room to go kill time. When we came back it was still damp and the smell was covered up by air freshener. In addition to this major inconvenience the room and decor were quite outdated. We checked out the next morning instead of staying the extra night and the front desk woman was VERY unpleasant towards my boyfriend as if this was our fault.

There were rubber rugs laid down that were uneven. A paint job is long overdue. Within minutes we were approached by someone asking for money so they could get a room.
