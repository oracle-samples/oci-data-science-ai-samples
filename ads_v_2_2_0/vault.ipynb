    "The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault is a service that provides management of encryption keys and secret credentials. A vault is a storage container that holds keys and secrets. The Vault service not only secures your secrets it provides a central repository that allows them to be used in different notebooks and shared with only those that need access. No longer will your secrets be stored in code that can accidentally be checked into git repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a vault, a key, and store a secret that is encrypted with that key. It also demonstrates how to retrieve the secret so that it can be used in a notebook. The notebook explains how to update that secret and basic operations, such as listing deleting vaults, keys, and secrets.\n",

    "# Introduction to the Vault Service\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm) lets you centrally manage the encryption keys that protect your data and the secret credentials that you use to securely access resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaults securely store master encryption keys and secrets that you might otherwise store in configuration files or in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Vault service to exercise control over the lifecycle keys and secrets. Integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) lets you control who and what services can access which keys and secrets and what they can do with those resources. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit integration gives you a way to monitor key and secret use. Audit tracks administrative actions on vaults, keys, and secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are stored on highly available and durable hardware security modules (HSM) that meet Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Security Level 3 security certification. The Vault service uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as its encryption algorithm and its keys are AES symmetric keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='concepts'></a>\n",
    "# Key and Secret Management Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The following concepts are integral to understanding the Vault service.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='vaults'></a>\n",
    "## Vaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaults are logical entities where the Vault service stores keys and secrets. The Vault service offers different vault types. A virtual private vault is an isolated partition on an HSM. Vaults can share partitions on the HSM with other vaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='keys'></a>\n",
    "## Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are logical entities that represent one or more key versions that contain the cryptographic material used to encrypt and decrypt data. The Vault service recognizes master encryption keys, wrapping keys, and data encryption keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Master encryption keys can be generated internally by the Vault service or imported to the service from an external source. Once a master encryption key has been created, the Oracle Cloud Infrastruture API can be used to generate data encryption keys that the Vault service returns to you. by default, a wrapping key is included with each vault. A wrapping key is a 4096-bit asymmetric encryption key pair based on the RSA algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='key_version'></a>\n",
    "## Key Version\n",
    "\n",
    "Each master encryption key is assigned a version number. When a key is rotated, a new key version is created by the Vault service or it can be imported. Periodically rotating keys reduces the risk if a key is ever compromised. A key’s unique OCID remains the same across rotations, but the key version enables the Vault service to seamlessly rotate keys to meet any compliance requirements. Older key versions cannot be used for encryption. However, they remain available to decrypt data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='hsm'></a>\n",
    "## Hardware Security Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys and secrets are stored within an HSM. This provides a layer of physical security. Keys and secrets are only stored on HSM and cannot be exported from the HSM. HSMs meet the FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3 security certification. This means that the HSM hardware is tamper-evident, has physical safeguards for tamper-resistance, requires identity-based authentication, and deletes keys from the device when it detects tampering.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='envelope_encryption'></a>\n",
    "## Envelope Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "The data encryption key used to encrypt your data is, itself, encrypted with a master encryption key. This concept is known as envelope encryption. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services do not have access to the plain text data without interacting with the Vault service and without access to the master encryption key that is protected by IAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='secret'></a>\n",
    "## Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "Secrets are credentials, such as passwords, certificates, SSH keys, or authentication tokens. You can retrieve secrets from the Vault service when you need them to access resources or other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='secret_version'></a>\n",
    "## Secret Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each secret is automatically assigned a version number. When secrets are rotated and updated, the new secret has a new version number. A secret’s unique OCID remains the same across rotations and updates. It is possible to configure a rule that prevents a secret from being reused after rotation and updating. However, the older secret remains available.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='secret_bundles'></a>\n",
    "## Secret Bundles\n",
    "\n",
    "A secret bundle consists of the secret contents, properties of the secret, and the secret version (version number or rotation state), and user-provided contextual metadata for the secret."
