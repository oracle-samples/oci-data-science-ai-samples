Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with a cell permeable BK channel blocker, we show that mitoBK modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production, and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the 'Warburg effect', thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK and BK transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK could represent a treatment strategy for selected BC patients in future.\n"

      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that nonautoimmune diabetes occurs in underweight individuals in sub-Saharan Africa and is characterized by the absence of visceral adiposity, reduced late-phase insulin secretion, and greater insulin deficiency. These findings necessitate further studies to inform how the prevention, identification, and management of diabetes in such individuals can be individualized.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is common in relatively lean individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. It is unclear whether phenotypic differences exist between underweight and normal-weight African patients with type 2 diabetes. This study compared specific characteristics between underweight (body mass index <18.5âkg/m) and normal-weight (body mass index of 18.5-24.9âkg/m) adult Ugandans with new-onset nonautoimmune diabetes.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the leading cause of death globally, are estimated to overtake communicable diseases in sub-Sahara Africa, where healthcare workers (HCWs) play a crucial role in prevention and treatment, but are in extreme shortage, thereby increasing the burden of NCDs among this specific population. To provide evidence for policy-making, we assessed the NCD burden, associated factors and treatment among HCWs in four sub-Saharan African countries.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study across four sub-Saharan African countries [CÃ´te d'Ivoire (CIV), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Madagascar (MDG), and Nigeria (NIG)] between February and December 2022. In a standardized questionnaire, sociodemographic, chronic disease and treatment data were self-reported.

      "RESULTS: From the total of 728 records screened, 8 studies with 2,471 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in this systematic review. The estimated pooled prevalence of poor sleep quality in Ethiopia was 48.54%.\n",

The preparation of brochures on diabetic information and the organization of health education about the negative impact of poor sleep quality on patients are among the best modalities to improve the problem of poor sleep quality.\n",
      "RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of PLWH and age- and sex-matched HIV-negative participants who were purposely recruited from clinics in Brighton, U.K. Each participant wore a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 10 days, had glucose measured during an oral glucose tolerance test, and fructosamine and paired HbA1c were measured.

      "OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is reported to be more common in people living with HIV (PLWH). Clinical guidelines recommend screening for diabetes in PLWH, but there is no agreed method due to studies reporting HbA1c is falsely low in PLWH. These studies were performed in the early HIV era when participants were taking older preparations of antiretroviral therapy that are rarely used today. We aimed to investigate whether HIV serostatus influences HbA1c.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The prevalence of self-reported chronic disease varied across the four sub-Saharan countries with potentially very low treatment rates. We identified several individual (age, sex, and BMI) and occupational (profession, level of healthcare) factors that influence the odds of NCDs. These factors should be taken into account when developing interventions addressing the burden and management of NCDs among HCWs.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Diabetes disproportionately affects African Americans, leading to higher morbidity and mortality. This study explores the experiences of African American adults who successfully self-manage their type 2 diabetes (called Peer Ambassadors) and provided phone-based peer support in a 6-month culturally tailored diabetes self-management program for African Americans guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model.\n",
      "among patients with HbA1c <7%, possibly due to their efficacy, safety profiles, or availability of newer alternatives.

Higher variability and blood sugar peaks were observed in patients with HbA1c levels above 7%. In the Western region of Kazakhstan, metformin was the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, consistent with its first-line therapy status. Patients with HbA1c >7% were more likely to receive insulin therapy and SGLT-2 inhibitors, indicating their role in more intensive treatment strategies. Less use of incretins and sulfonylureas was noted\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality can exacerbate many other physiological functions, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure. Although primary studies were conducted in Ethiopia, no studies concluded the pooled prevalence of poor sleep quality in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence and its determinants of sleep quality among diabetes in Ethiopia.\n",
