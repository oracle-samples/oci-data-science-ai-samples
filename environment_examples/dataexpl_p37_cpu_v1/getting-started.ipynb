    "The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service is a fully managed platform for data science teams to build, train, and manage machine learning models using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Science service:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provides data scientists with a collaborative, project-driven workspace.\n",
    "* Enables self-service access to infrastructure for data science workloads.\n",
    "* Includes Python-centric tools, libraries, and packages developed by the open-source community and the [Oracle Accelerated Data Science Library](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/ads-sdk/latest/index.html), which supports the end-to-end lifecycle of predictive models:\n",
    "    * Data acquisition, profiling, preparation, and visualization.\n",
