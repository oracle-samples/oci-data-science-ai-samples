    "The Oracle Big Data Service ([BDS](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/bigdata/home.htm)) is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) service that is designed for big data use cases and supports Hadoop and Spark. BDS has features such as HDFS and Hive. You can use BDS for short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks, and long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes. To connect to BDS from a notebook session, the cluster must have Kerberos enabled. This notebook demonstrates how to configure Kerberos authentication using ADS.\n",

    "As a network security protocol, Kerberos authenticates requests between hosts. A trusted third-party and secret-key cryptography are used to perform the authentication. The protocol has three main entities, client, server, and the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The notebook is the client, and the server is the BDS. The role of KDC is to perform authentication and grant tickets. The tickets allow the client and server to verify identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Kerberos works by having the client make a request to authenticate. The KDC verifies the client's credentials and a number of messages are sent back and forth between the client, server and KDC. Ultimately, the KDC creates a service session key that is shared between the client and the server. This session key is used in the communication that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kerberos requires `keytab` and `krb5.conf` files. These are specific to each cluster and are obtained from the master node on the BDS cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='setup'></a>\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The best practice is to store the Kerberos credentials and configuration parameters in the vault. By doing this, access can be limited and auditing is supported. Further, it allows for the credentials to be rotated and updated in a single place. You don't have to update each notebook session because they pull the configuration parameters and Kerberos files from the vault as needed. ADS provides the `BDSSecretKeeper` class that makes connecting to BDS, Hive, and HDFS simple and secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must obtain two files from the master node on the BDS cluster. The keytab file and `krb5.conf` files must be stored on the block volume in the notebook session. The `krb5.conf` file is in the `/etc` directory of the BDS master node. If you're using a vault to store the credentials, these files are stored in the secure and convenient vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Kerberos authentication, you provide the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `kerb5_path`: The local path to the `krb5.conf` configuration file.\n",
    "- `keytab_path`: The local path to the principal's Keytab file.\n",
    "- `principal`: The unique identity to which Kerberos can assign tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to the BDS cluster's HDFS you need the hostname and the port. These aren't strictly needed to access BDS, but most data science workflows require at least occasional access:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hdfs_host`: The HDFS hostname to use to connect to the HDFS file system on the BDS cluster.\n",
    "- `hdfs_port`: The HDFS port to use to connect to the HDFS file system on the BDS cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "BDS provides access to Hive. To connect to Hive you need the hostname and the port:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hive_host`: The Hive hostname for the BDS cluster.\n",
    "- `hive_port`: The Hive port for the BDS cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the configuration parameters in the vault, you provide the OCIDs of the vault and the master encryption key:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `vault_id` = OCID of the vault.\n",
    "- `key_id` = OCID of the master encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the configuration parameters are already stored in the vault, all you need is the secret OCID that has the necessary information. It's safe to hardcode the secret OCID into a notebook because OCI IAM manages access.\n",
