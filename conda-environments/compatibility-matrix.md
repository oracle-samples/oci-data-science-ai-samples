# Service Conda Environments (SCE) Compatibility Matrix

## Overview
OCI Data Science is migrating customers from **legacy Service Conda Environments (SCEs)** to a new, supported set of **rebuilt SCEs**.

To minimize disruption, the migration follows a **soft deprecation** approach:
- Legacy SCEs will be **deprecated and hide** to prevent new adoption, but they will **remain available for existing consumers** while you migrate.
- You will receive **at least 30 days’ notice** before changes, along with replacement recommendations and migration guidance.

This page provides a **compatibility matrix** that maps each legacy SCE to the recommended new SCE, plus notes on expected differences and migration considerations.

## How to use this matrix
1. Identify the **legacy SCE name/version** you currently use (from your job, notebook session, model deployment).
2. Find the matching row in the table below.
3. Move to the recommended **replacement SCE** and follow the **migration notes** (especially for Python version changes and major library upgrades).
4. Validate in a dev/test workload before rolling into production.

## Compatibility Matrix (Legacy SCE → Replacement SCE)

### Column definitions (what we recommend tracking)
- **Legacy SCE**: the environment you use today.
- **Replacement SCE**: the recommended target (one of the new SCE).
- **Python**: legacy vs replacement Python version (common source of breaking change).
- **CPU/GPU + Architecture**: whether it’s CPU/GPU, and x86_64 vs aarch64.
- **Primary use-case**: general ML, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Spark, etc.
- **Key differences**: notable package/runtime shifts.
- **Support / deprecation status**: e.g., “Deprecated (hidden)” / “Removal scheduled”.

## Validation checklist
- Confirm your workload starts successfully on the replacement SCE.
- Run a small “smoke test” for key imports (e.g., numpy/pandas/sklearn/torch/tensorflow as applicable).
- Run one representative pipeline/job end-to-end (data access → train/infer → output).
- If you use compiled/native deps, validate runtime linkage issues early (common symptoms: missing shared libs).

## Support & exceptions
If you cannot migrate before removal timelines due to business constraints, contact support to discuss options and (where applicable) request a time-bound exception.
