    "1. **VHF (30 MHz - 300 MHz) and UHF (300 MHz - 3 GHz) bands**: These higher frequency bands are less affected by solar flares and geomagnetic storms. They are also less prone to ionospheric absorption, which can attenuate signals on lower frequency bands.\n",
    "2. **6 meters (50 MHz)**: This band is often considered a good choice during solar flares, as it is less affected by ionospheric disturbances and can provide reliable local and regional communications.\n",
    "3. **2 meters (144 MHz) and 70 cm (440 MHz)**: These bands are popular for local and regional communications and are often less affected by solar flares.\n",
    "4. **Microwave bands (e.g., 1.2 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz)**: These bands are even less affected by solar flares and can provide reliable communications over shorter distances.\n",

    "1. **HF (3 MHz - 30 MHz) bands**: These lower frequency bands are more susceptible to ionospheric absorption and geomagnetic storms, which can cause signal loss and disruption.\n",
    "2. **160 meters (1.8 MHz) and 80 meters (3.5 MHz)**: These bands are often the most affected by solar flares and geomagnetic storms.\n",

    "Keep in mind that the impact of solar flares on amateur radio communications can vary depending on the intensity of the flare, the location of the communicating stations, and the time of day. It's always a good idea to monitor space weather forecasts and adjust your communication plans accordingly."
